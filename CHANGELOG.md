# Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2024-12-19

### ðŸŽ¯ **Anti-Analysis Paralysis Feature**

#### **Single Recommendation Display**
- **Primary Change**: Home screen now shows only ONE random recommendation instead of a list
- **Random Selection**: App randomly chooses from tasks with the highest score to prevent decision fatigue
- **Hidden Full Results**: Complete results list is now a subtle, non-obvious feature in the Activities screen
- **Purpose**: Eliminates analysis paralysis by presenting a single, confident recommendation

#### **Smart Randomization Logic**
- **Highest Score Filter**: Only considers tasks with scores >= the highest score
- **Random Selection**: Picks randomly from top-scoring tasks to avoid bias
- **Fallback**: Returns null if no tasks have scores > 0

#### **Hidden Feature Implementation**
- **Subtle Access**: "Show top matches" button appears only when there are scored tasks
- **Toggle Functionality**: Users can expand/collapse the full results list
- **Non-Intrusive**: Hidden feature doesn't interfere with the main single-recommendation flow
