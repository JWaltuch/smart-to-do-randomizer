# smart-to-do-randomizer

This is another small project I was thinking about to help me choose what to do with free time when I have analysis paralysis.

Goals:
- Test coding with Cursor
- Working app I can use
- The app should provides a survey of questions. Each question adds or subtracts from a task's score based on its boolean properties (ex: fun, high-energy). The app will generate a random task based on the ones with the highest score
- I would love to make this app available on mobile.

Future Possibilities:
- Login, database with customizable tasks
